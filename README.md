## Programming Language Test
###Authored by Lauralee Green July 16, 2020 In response to the Second Code Review at Epicodus' Intro Into Programming Class for the May, 2020 Cohort.
###I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap to create what I have so far.
###It was built with Open Source guidelines like those of the MIT Open Source Licence.
###If you want to open this test, you are on your own. Git hub has me completely baffled! Two weeks ago I thought I was in control. Today, I am not.
