# Programming Language Test

## Authored by Lauralee Green July 16, 2020 In response to the Second Code Review at Epicodus' Intro Into Programming Class for the May, 2020 Cohort

## I used Epicodus lessons, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and Markdown to create this project

## It was created to be Open Source and copyright is held as an MIT Open Source Licence

## If you want to use this test, create your own repository here on Git Hub and give it any name you wish. Come back to this page of mine and "Fork" this repository in order save a copy for yourself. There is a button labeled: "Fork"  in the top right-hand corner of the listing. Click that and Git Hub will do the rest. 

## The user types their answers into the form fields and clicks the "Submit" button at the end of the form. A silly story is generated with the user's words from the form inserted into a story to offer up entertaining advice on Programming Languages to learn or avoid.
