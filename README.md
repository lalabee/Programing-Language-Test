###Authored by Lauralee Green July 16, 2020 In response to the Second Code Review at Epicodus' Intro Into Programming Class for the May, 2020 Cohort.
###I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap to create this page.
###It was built with Open Source guidelines like those of the MIT Open Source Licence.
###If you want to use this test, create your own repository here on Git Hub and give it any name you wish. Come back to this page of mine and "Fork" this repository in order save a copy for yourself. The "Fork"button is green and labeled: "Fork"  in the top right-hand corner of the listing.
